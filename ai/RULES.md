# Project Rules

Rules for Copilot when working in this repo:
- One task at a time from @/ai/TASKS.md.
- After each, show diff + how to test it.
- Always ask for my approval before moving on.
- If unsure, propose 2â€“3 options with pros/cons, then ask me to pick.
- Prefer small, safe edits over big rewrites.
- Keep explanations in bullet points, not essays.
