# Rules for AI agent (this repo)

## General Principles:
- Work on one task at a time from @/ai/TASKS.md.
- After each, show the diff + how to test the change.
- Always ask for my approval before moving on.
- If unsure, propose 2–3 options with pros/cons, then ask me to pick.
- Prefer small, safe edits over big rewrites.
- Keep explanations in bullet points, not essays.

## README.md Updates:
- Only suggest edits to README.md when:
  1. A new feature is user-facing and requires explanation.
  2. Setup instructions, commands, or dependencies have changed.
  3. API endpoints, environment variables, or config options are added/modified.
  4. There is critical information new contributors need.
- Never add marketing fluff or duplicate info already in PRD.md or TASKS.md.
- When a README update is needed:
  - Summarize in plain language (2–5 lines max).
  - Place changes in the appropriate section (e.g., "Setup", "Usage").
  - Ask for approval before writing to README.md.

## Style:
- Write in clear, scannable English (short sentences, bullets preferred).
- Always show me the exact diff before applying changes.
