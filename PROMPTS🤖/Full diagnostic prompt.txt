We have completed Phase 1. Now proceed to Phase 2: Enhancement, Phase 3: Production, and Phase 4: Advanced Features. Integrate Onyx where possible to optimize local data searches, minimize costs, and review if Onyx can also handle other optimizations. Provide a recommendation first on how to implement this integration, considering the existing codebase and previous changes (e.g., enhanced search API endpoints, repository layer updates, and database indexes in lib/appwrite/collections.ts, app/api/search/route.ts, lib/repos/promptRepo.ts, and app/search/page.tsx). Ensure the integration focuses on efficiency, cost reduction, and seamless compatibility with the current Next.js app structure.

FULL Diagnostic Promopt
Run a comprehensive diagnostic on the application, including starting the development server with npm run dev, checking server status, verifying database connections and indexes in lib/appwrite/collections.ts, testing the enhanced search API endpoints in app/api/search/route.ts for pagination and multi-field search functionality, validating the updated repository layer in lib/repos/ for CRUD operations, and performing end-to-end tests on the search page (app/search/page.tsx) and filters component (components/search/Filters.tsx) to ensure proper rendering, state management, and integration with recent diffs applied. Report any errors, performance issues, or inconsistencies in the code.
